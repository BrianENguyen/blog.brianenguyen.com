Hi! I'm a software engineer. This website is mainly designed for me to document
my life and to explore interests other than software development. I guess this is mainly
a blog website, but I'm still thinking of what other features to put on here.
Glad you decided to check out this site!

Here are some fun facts of me to see if you would be interested in my site:

- I am a Linux enthusiast who actively supports online freedom and privacy, including organizations such as Wikipedia, the Free Software Movement, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
- My favorite music genre is pop punk, and my favorite artist is Linkin Park.
- I have two pomeranians: Kiki and Lucky, who I love dearly. My other pomeranian, Mimi, is on her new exciting journey in her new life.
- Like most people in tech, I have a big passion for video games.
  - my tastes in games always change. One day I might be playing Dyson Sphere Program, another day might be Dark Souls, and another day might be Slay The Spire
- I love playing the drums. My passion for it came from making pen-tapping beats in middle-school, then that turned into bucket drumming, then into the cajon, then into a drum set. Pop punk is my favorite genre to play it on because of its fast-paced nature
- I love working out. Even though I've been very active for the past few years, I've started taking it very seriously and learning about the in's-and-outs of workout and nutrition
