In Chinese, &ldquo;tzu&rdquo; means &ldquo;compassion,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chi&rdquo; means &ldquo;relief.&rdquo; &ldquo;With open arms
and helping hands, our volunteers are here to serve you.&rdquo; The Tzu Chi Foundation
is a global relief organization that focuses on charity, medicine, education,
and humanistic culture. This blog documents my experiences with this
organization starting from 2016 up until now.

## Becoming an Officer / Starting My Passion in Photography

During my first year with CSULB Tzu Ching, an officer was unable to fulfill her
role as historian, which involved taking photos at events for documentation
purposes. As someone who owned a DSLR camera but didn&rsquo;t use it much, I was
interested in the position and applied for it. The officer board found me to be
a good fit and was offered the position. The president of the organization told
me that my photography skills were not the primary factor in their decision, but
rather my dedication to the organization. I was thrilled for the chance to work
with the officers, improve my photography abilities, and contribute to CSULB Tzu
Ching through this role.

## Tzu Ching Social Day

The largest event ever held by CSULB Tzu Ching was the Tzu Ching Social Day on
February 25, 2017. This yearly event brought together Tzu Ching members from
various southern California colleges for a day of socializing and getting to
know one another. CSULB Tzu Ching hosted the event, with a focus on
environmental protection as the theme. Attendees included Tzu Ching members from
other colleges such as UC Irvine, UC San Diego, and UC Southern California.
During the event, the CSULB Tzu Ching officer board gave a presentation on how
Tzu Chi promotes environmental protection through initiatives such as using
recycled plastic to make clothes and promoting vegetarianism. This event was
also significant for me, as I fulfilled my new role as historian, and it remains
one of the most memorable events we&rsquo;ve hosted.

## Bridging the Gap for CSULB / UCI Collaborations

During the summer of 2017, I stumbled upon a senior-center volunteering event
posted on UCI Tzu Ching&rsquo;s Facebook page. Seeking an opportunity to do something
meaningful, I contacted them and was soon volunteering alongside UCI Tzu Ching
members. We spent the day socializing with seniors and performing to help
brighten their day. It was during this event that I met all of UCI Tzu Ching&rsquo;s
officers and advisors.

As the summer progressed, UCI Tzu Ching held another volunteering event, a
tutoring session for kids in grades three, four, and five. As someone who had
tutored children in the past, this event was particularly meaningful to me, and
I was thrilled to be able to participate alongside UCI Tzu Ching.

After the tutoring event, we hung out at a restaurant and got to know each other
better. This experience helped me form connections with the UCI Tzu Ching
officers, and in the months and years that followed, I continued to volunteer
with them. This eventually led to a collaboration with CSULB Tzu Ching, which
continues to this day. It all started with me being bored on a summer day and
seeking a way to make a difference.

## Becoming the _Only_ Officer for CSULB Tzu Ching and Leading It When No One Else Would

Around 2018, CSULB Tzu Ching experienced a decline in membership, which hurt our
events and the chances of recruiting new officers for the following school
years. As vice-president, I couldn&rsquo;t understand why this was happening and felt
frustrated and depressed about the situation. At the end of the 2018-2019 school
year, we were unable to fill officer positions, and I was ready to give up.
However, my advisors convinced me to continue with their support, and I went
into the 2019-2020 school year as the only officer.

During the club fair event, which my advisors, a few past members, and I
volunteered for, we were able to get around 100 people to sign up for our
mailing list in just two days. Although this number was high, I had low
expectations due to our low turnout rates in the past. I wasn&rsquo;t expecting many
people to attend our first meeting that year.

On September 9, 2019, the first meeting was scheduled to be held. I arrived at
the meeting room an hour early to prepare. However, I was not expecting a big
turnout, and thought only five people would show up. Twenty minutes before the
meeting, one person arrived, which was unusual because we never had someone show
up that early. But then, a few minutes later, more people started showing up one
by one. Outside the room, there was even a line of people waiting to get in. To
my surprise, past officers and members of CSULB Tzu Ching, my friend from high
school, and even my dad showed up. I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes and felt
overwhelmed with emotion.

## Revitalizing CSULB Tzu Ching / Current Times

From that point on, CSULB Tzu Ching experienced success in its events, with many
members attending and gaining more interest in our organization&rsquo;s values. I was
grateful that the advisors and I inspired a new generation of officers for the
next school year. When the school year ended, CSULB Tzu Ching continued
functioning for the following years, and as I write this, it still functions.
I&rsquo;m glad that my officer journey ended on a high note. As an alumnus, I continue
to support this organization, whether by maintaining the CSULB Tzu Ching
website, providing photography at events, or advising current officers.

If there is anything that I&rsquo;ve learned during my journey, it&rsquo;s this: _Giving up to prevent things from getting worse is not the way to go. Rather, you should not give up so that you don&rsquo;t prevent things from getting better._

## Special Thanks

I dedicate this blog to the following who have been with me through this
journey:

- **Lily and Weili** - these two were the founders of CSULB Tzu Ching. They&rsquo;ve made
  sure that I wouldn&rsquo;t handle the organization all on my own. Without their
  valuable advice, we wouldn&rsquo;t be able to make the 2019-2020 school year a
  successful one.

- **Jessica** - she took the initiative in being the president when we were
  experiencing down times. She had more experience in leadership and managing
  the organization than I have, so I learned valuable advice from her so I could lead the organization

- **UCI Tzu Ching** - I&rsquo;ve developed deep relationships with them, which also opened the door to collaborations that are happening to this day. I&rsquo;ve been to many of their events, and in turn, they&rsquo;ve considered me as an honorary UCI Tzu Ching member.

- **Shi Gu&rsquo;s and Shi Buo&rsquo;s** - these are Tzu Chi volunteers who continuously
  provided help with our events, such as bringing food at meetings, helping
  attract new members, and organizing events for CSULB Tzu Ching to attend.

- **Samanta, Victoria, Vivienne** - the president, vice president, and secretary of
  CSULB Tzu Ching for the 2020-2021 school year, respectively. They took the
  opportunity to become officers and help the organization grow for another year
  after I graduated. Not only have I inspired them, but they have also inspired
  me.
