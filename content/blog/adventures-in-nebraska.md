> Written in Brian's perspective unless noted otherwise

Thu visited Nebraska for the first time while she was on winter break. This blog
documents the many adventures we had during her time here.

## Airport Arrival / Drive Home

As Thu was on her flight from California to Nebraska, the American Airlines app
on her phone caused her phone to crash. At that time, we didn't know that
the app was the cause. She said that turning it on again or charging it didn't
solve the issue. I was very worried that there was no way to communicate with
her while she was traveling.

There was quite a heavy snowstorm as I made my way to the airport. I saw some
cars on the side of the road that were either stuck in snow or had fallen into
a ditch. I was worried that the storm would impede my travels there and that Thu
wouldn't know where I was. Nevertheless, I made it there without any adversity.

Seeing each other at the airport brought a lot of joy between us. We hadn't seen
each other for months since she was studying at California State University,
Fullerton and I was working in Nebraska.

Unfortunately, when we tried to leave the parking lot, the airport did not clear
the exit of the snow, which left us and another person stuck in the snow for hours.
I called my friend to help shovel snow from underneath. We spent about an hour
trying to get my car out but to no prevail. Eventually, we had to call a tow
truck to get us out. Not an ideal first experience in Nebraska for her

As we drove home, I asked Thu what she thought of the surroundings since
being in a rural environment was drastically different. At the time, she didn't
feel different, but that later changed as she experienced Nebraska more. We
arrived home at 3 AM and were very tired from the experience. I made topokki to
celebrate her arrival. We ate topokki many times back in Cali at one of our favorite
Korean restaurants, but this is the first time I cooked it for her. She enjoyed it a lot!

## Runza

Runza is a regional cuisine of Nebraska. It is a stuffed breading filled with
ground beef, cabbage, and onion, and it's very popular in this state. It tastes
a lot like a philly cheese steak sandwich.

During winter time, they have a unique promotion called Temperature Tuesday,
where if you were to order a regular runza with fries and a drink, the cost of
the runza will equal to the amount of the lowest temperature in Nebraska. For
example, if the lowest temperature was 30°, then the cost of the runza would be
30¢. When we ordered runza combos, the lowest at the time was 0°, so the price
of the runzas were free!

## Museums

### Hastings Museum

The Hastings museum was the first museum we've visited. It had a wide variety of
exhibits, such as antiques, fossiles, rocks & minerals, wildlife, and weapons.
What was unique about it was that also had an exhibit of Kool-Aid, which
Hastings is also the birthplace of Kool-aid. Unfortunately I didn't get a lot of
photos from it

### Great Platte River Road Archway Monument

The Kearney Archway Museum was one of the most unique museums we've visited. It
details stories of the pioneers in the mid-1800s who traveled across America to
the north to start better lives for them and their families, all the way to the
1950s. The exhibits were set up to feel immersive and like we were actually there.
They incorporate many sounds, lighting, and realistic props. Additionally, the
museum also has an audio-guided tour, where we could use a phone-like device to
connect to a plaque placed on an exhibit, and the audio tour related to that
exhibit would play.

I highly recommend visiting this museum if you're ever around the area. It's
an amazing experience

On our way home, we've witnessed one of the most beatiful sunsets during our
time in Nebraska. The beautiful orange glow mixed with the dark blue sky was a
perfect end to our day.

## Downtown Hastings

> From Thu:

"Hastings downtown is my favorite place to walk around because of its vibe and
architecture. The signs there impress me a lot. It's like a present with good
wraps. Walking into these stores brings me feelings of peace and warmth. The
pace of life is slow, allowing us more time to contemplate our lives and how to
improve them. It also encourages us to treat others more gently. Drinking a cup
of mocha next to a chimney and reading books while it's snowy outside feels like
a retreat for my winter break. I went to The Fahrm Bar when Blue Moon Coffee was
about to close and enjoyed the vibe of young people there. I also visited small
stores to learn about the lifestyle there. The Frame Lady carries different
styles of frames, and there is a store that sells very good-smelling bar soap.
There are also stores that sell beautiful clothes and shoes. Yet, there are some
office supply stores that have only a few visitors because it's hard to compete
with franchises like Walmart. Going around, feeling the vibe, and learning about
the culture of the community just makes me happy. It's like a retreat, an
opportunity for me to open my mind."

### Julie's Xpressions

There's a bead store in downtown Hastings called "Julie's Xpressions." It
specializes in making beaded bracelets and necklaces. We went there to make
beaded bracelets for each other. The store had a myriad of options to customize
our bracelets, and surprisingly for very cheap. The workers there are very kind
and patient while they guided us in making our custom beads.

This was Thu's favorite place in all of Nebraska because it allowed her to
express her creativity. She would love to return here again so she could
spend all day making beaded crafts!

## Conclusion

From our experiences, Thu considers Nebraska a great state for vacation, as the
Nebraskan life was way less hectic and more peaceful than in Cali. She is eager
to come back to Nebraska again in the summer.

We've hoped you enjoyed this blog. We plan on making another blog for our summer
trip together. This time, we will document our adventures in Lincoln, Omaha, and
more, so be on the lookout for that!
