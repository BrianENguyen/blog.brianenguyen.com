This is a June 2024 update of my workout progress since I started my "serious"
workout journey. I plan on making these blogs whenever I have significant
progress or updates in my journey.

## Being Stronger

I am still currently lifting 20-lb dumbells and I can feel them being easier to
use. Out of curiosity, I once tried to lift 15-lb dumbbells to get a sense of 
how much progress I've made, and they were so easy. I had a sense of
accomplishment that the weights that I have lifted for months felt easy.

A significant milestone in my workout journey is I got myself a new barbell set!
One of my neighbors had an old barbell bench set that was no longer being used.
I managed to snag it off of him and cleaned off all the dust and dirt. Now, it's
looking brand new!

This is actually the first time I've barbell benched in my life. Before, I was
shy to use it at the gym; plus, the barbell benches were constantly used by
others.  Using this gave me more confidence to use this at the gym again. I made
sure to learn proper technique while bench. I can currently bench 85-lbs and
hope to increase the weight soon.

This story may seem small compared to other's, but I am very proud of how much I
have accomplished. My arms look bigger, and I feel that I'm much stronger too

## Things I've Learned

I have learned many useful things within a month of my routine.

## New Workout Routine

I have made a slight adjustments to my weekly workout routine. Below is a high
level overview of what it is like. There are no specific days in which I perform
them; just whichever comes next:

+ Day 1 - Arm lifting
+ Day 2 - Legs
+ Day 3 - Abs + Cardio
+ Day 5 - Yoga
+ Day 6 - Rest

I don't plan on taking breaks
