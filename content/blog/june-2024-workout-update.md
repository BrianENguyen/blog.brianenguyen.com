This is an update of my workout progress since I started my "serious" workout
journey. I have definitely learned a lot so far.

## Being Stronger

I am still currently lifting 20-lb dumbells and I can feel them being easier to
use. Out of curiosity, I once tried to lift 15-lb dumbbells to get a sense of 
how much progress I've made, and they were so easy. I had a sense of 

what I have been using for many months, and they felt so easy. I felt proud that
I am being stronger.

I took my strength training and got myself a new dumbbell set! One of my
neighbors had an old barbell bench set that was no longer being used.  I managed
to snag it off of him and cleaned off all the dust and dirt. Now, it's looking
brand new!

I made sure to learn proper technique while bench. I can currently bench 85-lbs
and hope to increase the weight soon.

My arms look like they are getting bigger, and I feel that I'm much stronger too

I don't plan on taking breaks
