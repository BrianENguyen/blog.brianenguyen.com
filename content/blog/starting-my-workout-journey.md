# Starting My (Serious) Workout Journey

I've always been active working out, but a big problem is that I never
bothered to learn the in's and outs of fitness. This includes proper exercises
and nutrition. I would do my workout routine, eat whatever I want, and that's
it. This resulted in never fully achieving the weight and body I wanted. I was
always stagnant in having the same body for years. This, however, changed recently

## The Motivation

Recently, I've been watching one of my favorite Twitch streamers <a target="_blank" href="https://twitch.tv/wooliegaming">WoolieGaming</a>
being a terrible gamer as usual, and occasionally he would bring up fitness discussions.
One of the most recent ones he made around April of this year was counting
calories. He said to start using an app to track calories and have a baseline on
what you are eating for a week. Afterwards, depending if you'd
want to lose or gain weight, it's really simple: eat less to consume less
calories, or eat more to consume more calories. He also mentioned that it's ok to eat
whatever you want, including junk food, as long as the calorie intake is balanced
through the entire week.

This prompted me to started using a calorie tracker app again. I say "again"
because I used MyFitnessPal a few years back, but it was (and probably still is)
ridden with ads. Plus, I thought it was tedious to constantly track what I'm eating.
I didn't know how I could track foods that doesn't have any nutrition information. This
year, someone from Twitch chat recommended <a href="https://www.mynetdiary.com/" target="_blank">MyNetDiary</a>
because it doesn't bombard the user with ads. Aside from the annoying occasional
popup that advertises its premium subscription, as well as a very confusing UI/UX, this is definitely an amazing app.
It helps me easily track what I'm eating just by scanning the bar code of my ingredients. This would
then add the food to my meal and the calories and macros I'm consuming for each meal. From this, this made
me read food labels carefully when shopping for ingredients.

## Changing My Workout

Another tip that Woolie also mentioned is that when it comes to lifting, it's
better to lift heavier weights than to lift the same weight with more sets /
reps. I've been lifting 15lb dumbbells for about 6 months, so this prompted me
to finally upgrade to 20lbs. I did my first 20lb workout not to long ago and
it was fairly challenging but not too difficult.

I also tried <a href="https://ddpyoga.com">DDP Yoga</a> after hearing so great
testimonies from it. It was very intense, but satisfying. I hope to use the
program to help slim down my abs and to improve my flexibility.

I plan to buy a bench press set at some point to try it for the first time. Yes, you
read that right. I've never done bench presses in my life! I hope to use this
so I can work on my chest and arms.

## Current Workout Routine

Here's my current workout routine, with each category split into days

### Cardio

- 10x2 tricep extensions
- 10x2 pushups
- 16x2 one at a time curls

## Yoga

- DDP yoga for ~30 minutes

## Abs

All routines are during 45-second intervals, with 15-second break in between. Done in 3 sets

## Goals

I'm currently 6ft 1in, 180lbs with 74 resting heart rate. I hope to lower my
heart rate, gain 10lbs and more muscle mass by around July, and achieve a
consecutive jump rope record. I'll be sure to upload another blog that documents
my progress, so be on the lookout for that!
