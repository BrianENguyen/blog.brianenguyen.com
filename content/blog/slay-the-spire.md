Slay the Spire is (so far) my most-played game of 2024. If you don't know, it's
a turn-based roguelike card deck builder game where you would battle dangerous
enemies using your cards that have different abilities.
Defeating enemies would make you advance floors. Advancing floors will reward
you with new cards, potions, and power-ups to strengthen your character. The goal is 
to reach the top of the Spire and defeat the final boss.

    Here's the game's Steam page
</a> if you would like to check it out.

This blog is dedicated to my love of Slay The Spire and how I got addicted to it 

## The Beginning

I bought Slay the Spire back on the 4th of July, 2020 when it was on sale for
$12.49. It was on my wishlist ever since it was in early access, but bought it
until it went on discount.

My favorite character at the time was the Silent because of her poison builds. I
had a fondness for builds where I can just let damage-over-time do all of the
work for me while I sit there and block incoming attacks.

As time went on, I dropped the game for other ones I thought were more
entertaining. I've beaten Act 3 a few times and completed up to Ascension 2, but
never beyond that.

## Constantly Playing It In 2024

In 2024, I found myself constantly traveling by airplane a lot. I needed a game
that was portable and would be enough to run on my T480 Thinkpad. I had an itch
to play a deck builder after seeing SpellRouge on Steam. I was on the verge of
buying it until I completely remembered that I had Slay the Spire collecting
dust in my library. I decided to play it and got really hooked. I would spend 
countless hours playing StS whenever I could, such as on breaks, lunch time, 
and after work. I constantly thought of Slay The Spire and wanted to play it; 
it has became an addiction.

## Improving My Run Consistency

I was determined to learn more about the game since I was getting pretty
frustrated in not improving my runs, which resulted in me dying a lot.

Upon my return back to the Spire, I've learned a myriad of essential tips to
improve my runs, such as:

- not take every card reward every time I've been presented with one. This
resulted in clogging up my deck, which lowered the chances of drawing the cards I
want.
- not play with a build in mind, meaning, do not play each run thinking that you
will get the build that you want. The RNG in this game will not always give you
the cards you want, so you are forced to make a build from the rewards given to
you
- it's better to take cards (even ones you don't want) that would win fights
rather than skip them if they don't belong to my build.

I also started following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ig-JZyQoVpkOlyz9ODktg">Baalorlord
on YouTube and Twitch</a> and binge-watched his runs. His videos are so
entertaining and informative to watch, in that he caters to all players but
mainly focuses on helping newer ones.

## Experiences With Each Character

### The Ironclad

I always thought that Ironclad's "build strength, then bonk enemies" was his
main build archetype, but I soon found out that he has way more than that. My
favorite one that I did was the tank build, where I used Barricade (preserve
block each turn) + Body Slam (deal damage based on the amount of block) + Corruption
(all skills cost 0, but get removed from the deck until end of combat). With
this build, I was able to defeat the final boss for the first time, dealing more
than 100 damage for each Body Slam I play.

### The Silent

Despite her initially being my favorite character, I eventually found her to be
the most difficult. She has a terrible early-game run, where she has the most
starting cards but they don't do enough damage. I also think that she has really
bad matchups in Act 1, especially elites and bosses.  Nevertheless, I still
really enjoy playing a poison build when I get the right cards.

### The Defect

Also, another one of my favorite archetypes is minion builds. Even though the
Defect isn't considered a minion-based character, I still consider the
use of his orbs a minion-like build. I struggled with playing him initially,
but then I realized that in Act 1, he has very high damage with the lightning 
orbs. I used that knowledge to build defense, then eventually build power-scaling
cards. This tactic helped me climb the Ascensions quickly.

Defect's Echo Form card is probably my favorite card in all of Slay The Spire, which 
enables the first played card of every turn to be played twice. This can lead to 
absolutely broken synergies

### The Watcher

Holy moly, she is without a doubt the most OP character out of all the others, and also
the reason why I quickly climbed the ascensions quickly compared. Her stance
changes are so busted, making me deal double, even triple damage to enemies.
With the right cards and build, I can deal more than 150
damage with a card

My favorite card from her is Wallop, which deals 9 damage and gains block for
how much damage is dealt to the enemy. This is always a must-pick for me. Pairing
this with her stance changes, Wallop can gain even more block for the amount of
damage dealt, making this very consistent for damage and defense.

## Screenshots

Here are some of my favorite screenshots from my journey. *SPOILERS BELOW!*

    I didn't realize it at the time, but this was a very rare event.  It starts
    with me looting a body for money. Every time I loot the body, the
    chances of a powerful enemy that appears will increase. For every successful
    loot,  I had the chance to escape, but I kept looting for more riches.
    After three successful searches, this text appeared. How lucky I was! This
    only ever happened to me once out of 150 hours of playing.

## Conclusion

I'm so glad that I decided to get back into Slay The Spire. It has been one of,
if not, my most played game of 2024. I aim to get all the achievements in the game
and beat the hardest difficulty. I am also very excited that Slay The Spire II
coming in 2025 and I will get that immediately when it comes out. Until then,
the grind continues!
