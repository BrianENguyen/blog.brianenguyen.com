Slay the Spire is (so far) my most played game of 2024. If you don't know
anything about it, it's a turn-based roguelike card deckbuilder game where you
would battle dangerous enemies using your cards that has different abilities.
Defeating enemies would make you advance floors. Advancing floors will reward
you new cards, potions, and powerups to strengthen your character. The goal is 
to reach the top of the Spire and defeat the final boss.

This blog is dedicated to my love of Slay The Spire and how I got addicted to it 

## The Beginning

I bought Slay the Spire back on 4th of July, 2020 when it was on sale for
$12.49. It was on my wishlist ever since it was in early access, but it looked
like I waited until for it to go on discount.

My favorite character at the time was the Silent because of her poison builds. I
had a fondness of builds where I can just let damage-over-time builds do all the
work for me while I just sit there and block incoming attacks

As time went on, I dropped the game for other games I thought that was more
entertaining. I've beaten Act 3 a few times and completed up to Ascension 2, but
never beyond that.

## Constantly Playing It In 2024

In 2024, I found myself constantly travelling by airplane a lot. I needed a game
that was portable and would be enough to run on my T480 Thinkpad. I had an itch
of playing a deckbuilder after seeing SpellRouge on Steam. I was on the verge of
buying it until I completely remembered that I had Slay the Spire collecting
dust in my library.

I began playing it a lot during airplane travels, and I got hooked again. It
definitely

## Improving My Run Consistency

I was determined to learn more about the game since I was getting pretty
frustrated in not improving my runs.

Upon my return back to the Spire, one of the first and crucial / mandatory tip
is to not take every card reward every time I've been presented with one. This
resulted in clogging up my deck, which lowers the chances of drawing the cards I
want.

I also started following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1ig-JZyQoVpkOlyz9ODktg">Baalorlord
on YouTube and on Twitch</a> and binged watch his runs. His videos are so
entertaining and informative to watch, in that he caters to all players but
mainly focus on helping newer ones.

What I learned while playing StS was to NOT play with a build in mind, meaning,
do not play each run thinking that you will get the build that you want. The RNG
in this game gives me cards and items that will most likely not be suitable with
the build I want. I also learned that in the early game, it's better to take
cards (even ones you don't want) that would win fights rather than skip them if
they don't belong to my build.

## Experiences With Each Character

### The Ironclad

I always thought that Ironclad's "build strength, then bonk enemies" was his
main build archetype, but I soon found out that he has way more than that. My
favorite one that I did was the tank build, where I used Barricade (preserve
block each turn) + Body Slam (deal damage based on amount of block) + Corruption
(all skills cost 0, but get removed from the deck until end of combat). With
this build, I was able to defeat the final boss for the first time, dealing more
than 100 damage for each Body Slam I play.

### The Silent

Despite her initally being my favorite character, I eventually found her to be
the most difficult. She has a terrible early-game run, where she has the most
starting cards but they don't do enough damage. Nevertheless, I still really
enjoy playing a poison build when I get the right cards

### The Defect

Also another one of my favorite archetypes is minion builds. Even though the
Defect isn't really considered a minion-based character, I still consider the
use of his orbs a minion-like build. I struggled with playing him initially,
but then I realized that in Act 1, he has very high damage with the lightning 
orbs. I used that knowledge to build defense, then eventually build power-scaling
cards. This tactic helped me climb the Ascensions quickly.

Defect's Echo Form card is probably my favorite card in all of Slay The Spire, which 
enables the first played card of every turn to be played twice. This can lead to 
absolutely broken synergies

### The Watcher

Holy moly, she is definitely the most OP character out of all of them, and also
the reason why I quickly climbed the ascensions quickly compared to the other
characters. Her stance changes are so busted, making me deal double, even triple
damage to enemies. With the right cards and build, I can deal more than 150
damage with a card

My favorite card from her is Wallop, which deals 9 damage and gains block for
how many damage dealt to the enemy. This is always a must pick for me. Pairing
this with her stance changes, Wallop can gain even more block for the amount of
damage dealt, making this very consistent for damage and defense.

## Conclusion

I'm so glad that I decided to get back into Slay The Spire. It has been one of,
if not, my most played game of 2024. With Slay The Spire II coming out to early
access in 2025, I aim to get full completion by getting all of the
achievements beforehand.
