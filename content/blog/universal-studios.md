I recently visited Universal Studios Hollywood on the 18th and 21st of June.
This is the first time I have been there after more than 10 years. While some
aspects remained unchanged, there were numerous alterations, for better or for
worse. This blog documents my experiences throughout my time at Universal
Studios Hollywood, including my personal opinions on how much the park
transformed the past decade. Please note that this blog contains many of my
subjective opinions, and while you are welcome to agree or disagree, I kindly
request that you respect my opinions.

## tl;dr

Among all of my visits at Universal Studios Hollywood, this recent experience
stands out as my favorite by far. Despite the large crowds on Father's Day, I
was fortunate enough to experience nearly everything that the park has to
offer. While I did encounter some negatives, the pros ultimately outweighed the
cons.

### Pros

- Everything in Super Nintendo Land
- New Simpsons environment
- The Wizarding World of Harry Potter
- The Secret Life of Pets - Off the Leash
- Pink's Hot Dogs
- Every attraction that I've already experienced and liked
- Jurassic World - The Ride

### Indifferent

- Fast & Furious - Supercharged
- Giant pink frosted sprinkled donut
- Butter beer
- Despicable Me - Minion Mayhem
- Revenge of the Mummy - The Ride
- Only the _food_ at Chick Chick Chicken

### Did not experience

- Flight of the Hippogriff
- Every other attraction in The Wizarding World

### Cons

- Breakfast
- Studio Tour
- DreamWorks Theater
- Too many rides sharing the same theme and story concept
- Lackluster customer service at Chick Chick Chicken

## One of the worst breakfasts I had

To kickstart the day, we went to a France-themed restaurant for some breakfast.
I got a vegetarian "bánh mì" and Thu, my girlfriend, got crepes. As I picked the bánh
mì from the cold stand, Thu warned me that I shouldn't buy Asian food
at non-Asian restaurants because of the authenticity and quality of the food. I
still wanted to try it out and see if I would like it.

Unfortunately, the bánh mì was terrible. There was no protein in it, not even
tofu, and only consited of vegetables. Its tastes had no resemblance to the
authentic flavors of traditional bánh mì, leaving me confused as to why this
"bánh mì" bears that name. In addition, Thu had one of the strawberry
crepes. Even though it's called _STRAWBERRY_ crepe, there were barely any
strawberries in it. I don't understand why this restaurant at a highly-established
theme park can offer such low quality food.

## Studio Tour

As a kid, the first attraction that I always go to when I enter Universal
Studios is the studio tour. This attraction is a great introduction to park
visitors, allowing them to explore studio backlots and witness how films are
shot. We did the same thing again for this visit.

While the tour didn't change much, this experience wasn't as good as back when I
was a kid. The tour used to have exciting stops, such as Mini Skull Island, Fast
& Furious' Carnage and Carma, The Mummy, and Jaws. This time, none of those
attractions weren't present. The only two that were there were King Kong 3D and
Fast & Furious - Supercharged. The latter was the first time that I've
experienced this, and I believe it replace The Mummy studio tour experience. I
thought this attraction was ok, but overall, this studio tour didn't provide the
same excitement I had as a kid.

## The Simpsons

### The Simpsons Ride

Next, we went to The Simpsons ride. I'm still sad that this replaced the Back to
the Future ride, which I only got to ride it once before its replacement.
Nevertheless, I still greatly enjoy The Simpsons ride, and fortunately, nothing
changed about it since last time I've been there.

When The Simpsons ride was initially introduced, the surrounding scenery was
still undergoing construction. At that time, the only available spot was the
Kwik-E-Mart, offering Simpsons-themed souvenirs. However, the area has now been
transformed to include buildings and references from show. Some of these
structures serve as guest facilities, such as Moe's Tavern (a restaurant and
bar) and Luigi's Pizza.

### Giant Pink Frosted Sprinkled Donut

Arguably the most popular food item that's being sold in The Simpsons area is
the large Lard Lad Donuts. These donuts are colossal, approximately the size of
an average adult's head. There's dedicated store solely for selling these
donuts, and there is always a long line that forms outside. We decided to get
the giant pink frosted sprinkled donut since that is the most common donut
featured on the show.

The donut tastes good, but it's nothing special. It's just like every other
donut. Obviously the only selling point for these donuts is their tremendous
size, but it was still a good experience to try it out.

<figcaption>Mmmmm.... donuts.....</figcaption>

</figure>

## Waterworld

When it comes to intense, fast-paced, action-packed live shows, nothing comes
close to Waterworld. Inspired by the blockbuster film, Waterworld pushes the
boundaries of visitors' expectations, offering a spectacle that is rarely seen
in theme parks. It features death-defying stunts to exhilarating jet-ski
battles. Watching this show now still made me feel like the first time I watched
it.

Waterworld is my all-time favorite live action show at a theme park, and I'm
glad that it's still at Universal Studios. Nothing about it changed.

## The Wizarding World of Harry Potter

I've never consumed a single Harry Potter media, so please excuse me on my lack
of knowledge of Harry Potter.

Before the Wizarding World of Harry Potter was here, there used to be Shrek 4D
and a mini water park for children that was SpongeBob themed. Now that this area
has been established, the park feels so much bigger. I'm not a fan of Harry
Potter (nothing against it, I've just never had a chance to read the books or
watch the movies), but I must admit that the area was very immersive. I felt
like that I was inside of a medieval fantasy land. The giant castle that
houses the _Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey_ ride was colossal. It reminded me of the
castles found in the game _Dark Souls_.

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/buraiyen/image/upload/c_scale,w_1200,f_auto/v1620240510/BEN_Website/blog/Universal/BEN_castle.webp" alt="Thu standing in front of Harry Potter castle" loading="lazy" />

One of my friends recommended me to try the butter beer, and the butter beer
stand was the first thing I saw as I walked through the towering gates. The
butter beer is just root beer float. There are two variations of the butter
beer: cold and frozen. I had the frozen one and it's quite enjoyable. It's sweet
and a good beverage during a hot weather; however, $10 for one cup is
excessively high.

<figure>

<figcaption>Butter beer. Yum!</figcaption>

</figure>

The best attraction in this area was definitely _Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey_. This is one of the most unique rides I've ever seen. Unlike traditional
roller coasters, this ride has you suspended in a seat and you glide through many
obstacles and screens. It's honestly hard to describe how amazing this ride is and
how it works. Just know that it was a remarkable and unparalleled experience.

Unfortunately, I did not get to experience everything that the Wizarding World has
to offer. I know that there is _Flight of the Hippogriff_ and other minor attractions
in this area, but we decided to focus more on the main attractions in other areas.

## Illumination

Illumination Studios is known for producing popular animated films such
as _Despicable Me_, _The Secret Life of Pets_, and _Minions_. This new area is
dedicated to those films.

### Despicable Me - Minion Mayhem

The Despicable Me - Minion Mayhem replaced the Terminator ride. As a huge fan of the
Terminator ride and the movie series, I was sad that this was gone.

The Despicable Me ride is a 3D motion simulator that takes you through the story
where riders are transformed into minions and must go through the minion training
and obstacle courses to be certified minions. The ride itself was alright. It
had moderate levels of intensity and it was obviously targeted towards families and
children.

From a business standpoint, replacing Terminator with Despicable Me was the
right call. The Illumination area now attracts a large number of children and it
has way more activity than Terminator ever did, though a huge part of me still
wishes Terminator was here.

### The Secret Life of Pets - Off the Leash

The Secret Life of Pets ride offers a unique experience in which you would ride
in a car shaped like a cardboard box. The ride begins by transforming riders
into pets through a camera that tracks the riders' facial features (this facial
data is automatically deleted, per Universal Studios' privacy policy). Riders
can look at their pet counterparts and make different looks or body movements.
The ride then goes through the wacky adventures that pets go through while their
owners are away.

This wasn't a simulation ride like most other rides. Rather, this takes you
through various sets with physical props and backdrops that resemble the movies.
This was definitely a fun and unique ride for all ages. I didn't expect it to be
so entertaining.

## DreamWorks Theater

This attraction replaced Shrek 4D and instead offers different attraction themes
from different DreamWorks films, such as Shrek, Madagascar, and Kung Fu Panda.
The theme when I visited was Kung Fu Panda. I was hoping this attraction would
be the same or better quality compared to Shrek 4D. Unfortunately, this is way
worse than Shrek 4D. In Shrek 4D, it was presented like an actual movie with
special effects, like water sprinkling on the audience and the sensation of bugs
crawling underneath your feet.

As I experienced the DreamWorks Theater, I noticed a very similar pattern with
the rides I've been on. Most of them follow the same format of a 3D simulation
where the riders follow the characters on a journey through excitement and
danger. DreamWorks Theater follows this same format, which makes the attraction
very predictable and boring.

## Lunch

We've got lunch at Pink's Hot Dogs since I wanted to give Thu the
experience of a renowned, local, and famous hot dog restaurant.

The hot dogs were delicious. However, the chili inside my hot dog was
problematic at it was too hot or too cumbersome for the bun. This made the bun
break off, spilling the insides onto the plate. I had to eat the rest of the hot
dog with a fork. Despite the inconvenience, the hot dogs were still enjoyable.

## Super Nintendo Land

Super Nintendo Land opened in early 2023, and I was fortunate enough to have the
opportunity to experience it. As we approached the entrance, we had to go
through the green pipe, just like in the Mario video games to enter the area.
Walking through the green pipe had enchanting rainbow LED lights and played the
familiar sound of descending pipes.

Upon exiting the pipe, we found ourselves inside of Princess Peach's castle.
The atmosphere and design of the castle were heavily inspired by the iconic
castle from Super Mario 64. It truly felt like stepping into the world of
Mario.

Leaving Peach's castle behind, I was immediately captivated by the immersive
environment surrounding me. It was as if I had been transported into a real-life
Mushroom Kingdom. Everywhere I looked, I saw familiar elements such as lush grassy
hills, green pipes with pirahna plants, rotating coins, brick and power-up
blocks, goombas, koopas, Yoshi, and much more. The attention to detail was
astounding, and there were hidden surprises for those observant enough to spot
them.

Super Nintendo Land truly exceeded my expectations with its meticulous design
and faithful recreation of the Mario universe. It was an unforgettable
experience that brought the beloved video game series to life in a way that
delighted both young and old fans alike.

### Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge

This ride is the main attraction of the area. The wait was 90 minutes, the
longest I had to wait for an attraction that day, but I hoped that it would be
worth it. The queue line crosses through Bowser's Castle, and just like any
other area in Super Mario World, there is so much attention to detail. There are
racing trophies, a towering statue of Bowser, a Bob-Omb factory, and more. Among
my favorites were the bookshelves whose book titles are references to the Mario
Kart games. Such includes "The History of Moo Moo Farm" and one that shows
shortcuts in several Mario Kart maps.

As for the ride itself, words cannot adequately convey my level of amazement.
Each car accommodates four riders, and each individual can control the direction
of the kart. Equipped with interactive glasses, riders are immersed in the world
of Team Mario and Team Bowser, engaging in a thrilling competition. Using
buttons on the steering wheel, we had the exhilarating opportunity to launch
shells at Team Bowser while also collecting powerup blocks. Throughout the ride,
we ventured through iconic Mario Kart tracks, including Bowser's Castle and
Rainbow Road.

Among all the rides I've experienced at Universal Studios, this one undoubtedly
claims the top spot. Its innovative features, interactive gameplay, and the
sheer joy of participating in a real-life Mario Kart race left an indelible
mark. This is an experience that I will never forget.

## Other Lower Lot Attractions

</figure>

### Jurassic World

Jurassic World is a boat ride that takes riders through dinosaur habitats. The
travel suddenly takes a dangerous turn where carnivorous dinosaurs are let
loose.

The ride is essentially the same as the Jurassic Park ride, with
the only difference being the updated environments that give it a more modern
and futuristic feel.

### Transformers 3D

I _most likely_ have been on the Transformers ride before as a kid. Either way, it
was a very fun and fast-paced 3D ride that has riders transporting the All-Spark
to a safe location while the Autobots and Decepticons are battling each other.

### The Mummy

This is my first time experiencing The Mummy ride since I have always been
scared of roller coasters as a kid. The ride incorporates cinematic elements,
takes place in a dark setting, and even features reverse tracks. Although it
wasn't too intense, it provided a nice and memorable experience.

I guess my only complaint is that the ride wasn't too dark. Even inside the dark
room, I was still able to see the track paths, which somewhat diminished the
immersive experience for me.

## Dinner

We ate at Chick Chick Chicken at the City Walk for dinner. We ordered the
Asian-Style Chicken Sandwich and the Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. The food
here ranks between "good" and "great." They're tasty, can make you full for
hours, but they're nothing really special.

However, the customer service here is non-existent. I can tell that the employees
there don't want to be there and don't care about providing quality service.
For those reasons, I wouldn't go here again unless they improve their service.

## Conclusion

I had a blast with my experiences at Universal Studios. Super Nintendo Land
was once of the best places I've been in a theme park. Even though there were
some negatives at my visit, the pros outweighed the cons. Universal Studios
is a must-visit destination for California residents or tourists.
