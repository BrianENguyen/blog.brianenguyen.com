This is a November 2024 update of my workout progress since I started my
"serious" workout journey. Although I stated that I would make monthly workout
updates, I figured that I would instead make these blogs whenever I have
significant progress or updates in my journey.

## Being Stronger

I am still currently lifting 20-lb dumbells and I can feel them being easier to
use. Out of curiosity, I once tried to lift 15-lb dumbbells to get a sense of
how much progress I've made, and they were so easy. I had a sense of
accomplishment that I could lift these weights with ease after using them for
months.

When I was back in Nebraska, I got a barbell set and a bench, which I got used
from my neighbor. The bench had way too much dirt and dust on it, so I sprayed
oxyclean and hosed it down with water. Afterwards, it looks brand new.

This is actually the first time I've barbell benched in my life. Before, I was
shy to use it at the gym; plus, the barbell benches were constantly used by
others. Using this gave me more confidence to use this at the gym again. I made
sure to learn proper technique while bench. I can currently bench 85-lbs and
hope to increase the weight soon.

This story may seem small compared to others', but I am very proud of how much I
have accomplished. My arms look bigger, and I feel that I'm much stronger too

## Other Things I've Learned or Done

Here's a short list of things I've learned or done so far in my journey

- I've beaten my consecutive jump rope record from 187 to 209. My legs were on fire, but beating my record felt so satisfying
- Do not follow a set amount of reps within a set. Always continue until failure. I definitely felt that I get more of a workout from this method
- Spot reduction on my abs is a lot easier when I do light / moderate cardio first
- I started putting creatine in my protein shakes before my workout, and I do feel more energized doing so
- I stopped tracking my calories because I eat various different foods throughout the day. Instead, I estimate how many calories I get from carbs since they hold the most calories in a meal

## Conclusion

I'm really happy with the progress I've made. My next goals are changing my
dumbbell weights to 25 lbs and beating my jumprope record with at least a score
of 210. I'll be sure to update you when that happens. If you have any comments
or suggestions, then feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:hello@brianenguyen.com">hello@brianenguyen.com</a>.
Thank you very much for reading!
