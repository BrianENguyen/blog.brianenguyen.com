The use of website images is one of the major factors that contribute to
slow loading of web pages. In this blog, I discuss the reasons behind
how images can affect website speed and describe the methods I use to
optimize images on my sites, thus improving their load speed times.

## Image Downloads

When you visit a web page that contains images, your device sends a
request to the server for information about the page. The server
responds with the necessary files to display the page, including HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, images, and other components. This process is similar
to downloading a video game or a movie online. The larger the file size,
the longer it takes to download. This concept also applies to websites.

Images are typically large files by default, and if they are not
optimized, they can take longer to download, resulting in slower website
performance.

## Compressing Images and WebP Format

To optimize images, the first step is to compress the image files using
online file compressors. I recommend
[compressor.io](https://compressor.io/). It\'s a good idea to have a
copy of the original, uncompressed file in case for other uses.

Once the files are compressed, the next step is to convert them to WebP
format using an online file converter such as
[convertio.co](https://convertio.co/). The WebP format is 26% smaller
than PNG images while maintaining the same quality, making it essential
for website development.

## Lazy Loading Images

By default, when you visit a web page, all the images on that page will
download from the server. This isn\'t a big deal on pages with only a
few images, but it can be a problem on pages with lots of content that
require scrolling, like this one.

Why is it a problem? Let\'s say you load into a large page with many
images, but then you decide to visit another page without scrolling all
the way down. In that case, _all the images on the page have already
been loaded, even if you didn\'t see them_. This wastes your time and
server resources.

To solve this problem, we can use lazy loading, which means we only load
images when they\'re in view. Lazy loading helps us reduce loading time
and saves server resources. To implement lazy loading with the
`<img />`{.verbatim} HTML tag, you can use the loading attribute and set
its value to `lazy`{.verbatim}.

```html
<img src="example.webp" loading="lazy"/>
```

## Improving Load Times for Mobile Users

By now, you already know how to optimize images to improve load times,
but there\'s more you can do. Images have fixed properties, such as
size, that don\'t change regardless of the user\'s device. This may
cause longer load times on mobile devices, where a smaller image would
suffice without losing quality.

To address this, you can use dynamically rendered images. On my website,
I have two versions of the same image, one full-sized and one scaled
down to 600 pixels for mobile users. The code I use, specific to React
but adaptable to basic HTML, determines the screen width and displays
the appropriate version of the image accordingly. This reduces the file
size to about 40 KB and speeds up the download time.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcSet={props.src} media="(min-width: 600px)" />
  <img
    src={props.srcMobile}
    lazy-src={props.srcMobile}
    alt=""
    className="jumbotron__image"
    decoding="async"
    rel="preload"
  />
</picture>
```

To see this in action, go to any page on my website that has a jumbotron
(large image header), view the _Network_ tab in the developer tools, and
change the screen size. You\'ll notice that the image switches to the
smaller version for mobile devices, improving the loading time.

## Cloud-Based Image Management Services

Finally, utilizing cloud-based image management services can offer
benefits for improving image load times. Storing image files within the
project itself can require more download time, making cloud-based
servers a more reliable option. A specific service that I use is
[cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/). This service not only
improves my site\'s load speed and makes file management easier, but
also comes with various tools for manipulating images. I mainly use the
scaling and brightness adjustment tools for my images.

## Conclusion

To recap, you would need to follow these steps to help optimize your
images:

1.  Compress your images
2.  Convert your images WebP format (if not already)
3.  Have a full-sized and mobile-sized version of an image if the
    full-sized version has a large content paint. Render them
    dynamically
4.  Use a cloud-based image service like Cloudinary to render your
    images

I hope you have learned something new from this and can use these tips
to optimize and manage your images more effectively!
